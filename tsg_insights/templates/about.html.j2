      <p>
        This tool is designed to help explore grantmaking data published to the 360Giving data standard.
        It takes a 360Giving format file and turns it into an interactive dashboard.

          This tool uses the <a href="http://data.threesixtygiving.org/">360Giving data registry</a> to get a list of grants data
          published to the 360Giving data standard that can be explored with the tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of the files has been published by a grantmaker, usually on their own
          website, under a licence that allows the data to be reused and shared.
        </p>
        <p>
          They have used a common format - the 
          <a href="http://www.threesixtygiving.org/support/standard/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">360Giving data standard</a>
           - to make files in a consistent way.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you use one of the files through this website, the tool will fetch the
          data from the publishers website, make sure it fits the data standard, add
          some external data if it can and then display the results.
