          <h2>About 360Insights</h2>
          <p>
            360Insights is a free tool to help you understand funders better. 
            You can combine and visualise 360Giving and charity data, and 
            explore funding across seven different areas – from grant dates 
            to types of recipients.
          </p>
          <p>
            360Giving commissioned <a href="https://dkane.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">David Kane</a> to build 360Insights
            and <a href="https://www.ccmdesign.ca/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ccm.design</a> to design it.
          </p>
      <p>
        360Insights is completely free to use, and is built on open source technology and openly-licenced data.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can <a href="https://github.com/ThreeSixtyGiving/Insights" rel="noopener" target="_blank">view the site code on Github</a>. 
        The tool makes use of Open Source tools, such as <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>.

          <h2>Data sources</h2>
        <h3>
          Grantmakers
        </h3>
        <p>
          360Insights uses the <a href="https://www.threesixtygiving.org/data/360giving-datastore/">360Giving datastore</a> to retrieve grants data
          published by grantmakers to the 360Giving data Standard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of the files has been published by a grantmaker, usually on their own website,
          under a licence that allows the data to be reused and shared. 
          They have used a common format - the 
          <a href="http://www.threesixtygiving.org/support/standard/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">360Giving data standard</a>
           - to make files in a consistent way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data shown on 360Insights has been fetched from the publisher's website by the 360Giving datastore. The datastore checks
          that it fits the data Standard and adds some additional data about the geography and organisations include, if possible.
        </p>
        <h3>
          When will I see my data?
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you've published data in the 360Giving Data Standard, your data should be available on 360Insights
          a day or two after it is shown on the <a href="http://data.threesixtygiving.org/">360Giving registry</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't want to wait, you can upload your 360Giving format file instead. This file will be checked against the 360Giving
          Data Standard, and additional data on geography and organisations will be added where possible.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Other data
        </h3>
        <p>
          360Insights uses the 360Giving datastore, which adds external data from the following sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://findthatcharity.uk/">Find that Charity</a> is used to bring in data about charities 
          and other data sources.
