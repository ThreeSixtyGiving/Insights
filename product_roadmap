What do we want this product to do?
1. We want this product to provoke questions with data pubkishers regarding their data and giving. 
2. We want it to be a catalyst for more use. 

Who is the main audience? 
Staff in grantmaking organisations that published 360Giving with usually low capacity to analyse the data, either because they don't have 
the knowledge or the time to produce one. 

How we will achieve this?
1. We will display simple statisitcs about the dataset (this can be derived from the metadata file). 
2. We will combine 360Giving with charity commission data.
3. We will visualise the data so we can easily show people trends or patterns in the data. 
4. We will refer them to resources on how to do further analysis. 

Version 1.0 MVP - 
1. Allowing people to uplaod their own file or generate the graphs using the registy.  
2. Three different graphs combining 360Giving data and Charity commission data. 
3. Displaying future steps for analysis and other tools publishers should check (including Viz Challenge Fund examples). 
4. Displaying datasources and license. 
5. Allow people to download the graphs so they can use them later.
